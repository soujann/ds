  The P value value is the probability that the observed results (coefficients estimate) occurred by chance and there is no actual        relationship between independent and the depedent variable. In other words, P-value is the probability that the coefficient is zero.
The lower the p-value the higher the probability that a relationship exists between the dependent variable and the independent variable.
When the dependent variable has a p-value *below* 0.05, the relationship between it and the independent vaiable is statistically significant.
